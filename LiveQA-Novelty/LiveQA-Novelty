I have a few places on my jaw but not many. I have a majority of my acne on my forehead. I have like 2-3 white heads and the rest are just scars or acne with no heads. I wash my face everyday 2 times a day. And I have a acne treatment that keeps it from getting bad. So I rarely get big bumps. Just have a decent amount of small ones. And I have oily skin so it dosent help. My nose is the main spot that's oily. And beside my nose and a very lil on my cheeks. My forehead gets oily to but it's not to bad but it's bad enough to make me worry. Do these things matter to girls. I mean I'm a athlete in good shape and very tall but my confidence is basicly dead.
