I do not speak to strangers, and am constantly worried if I look stupid or strange. I have very awkward, jerky movements, and I look at others and they move just fine. As a child, I was exceptionally smarter than other children of my age, and loved to learn. The same applies to me now, at age 13, attending the eighth grade. I am a picky eater, but only because some food textures/flavors make me want to scream, and as a result I only eat a few foods. I have issues with sound, and sometimes I can't hear a person speaking in aloud room. Sometimes noises bother me to the point where I cover my ears. Sights do not bother me too much, but a lot of movement makes me uncomfortable. At times, I feel so uncomfortable that I fidget a bit.

I basically got there by eating less and exercising.  I still need to lose 50 lbs. (preferably by the end of this year), but I need to maintain and hopefully improve my strength and endurance.  I am poor, and health food is expensive.  It's not just that I'm a cheap bastard, I literally do not have the money to buy healthy food in plentiful amounts.  I lost 20 lbs this past month by eating a low calorie diet (900-1100 calories per day), but I'm afraid that I will just get to my goal weight of 190-200 lbs. without being physically fit enough to go to OCS.  Being a Marine is all I've ever wanted to do, and outside of that I couldn't care less what my body looks like.  The internet is so filled with bullshit either because no one genuinely knows how to lose fat quickly and effectively (except to have good genetics), or are actively keeping people in the dark.

Around 30 minutes later my breathing started to become short, like I had to take really deep breaths to catch it which hurt my chest, so I started to panick a bit. I tried to calm myself down and tried to look for one of my mom's inhalers if she had left any. (she had asthma) which I couldn't find any inhalers left ( I'm guessing she used them all) so I panicked even more and my brother noticed me and asked what's wrong, I told him blah blah blah and he called my dad from work and while we were waiting he gave me a steam thing that my mom used to use whenever she couldn't breathe well. After I went to the hospital and they didn't tell me what's wrong and whatnot, I think I was shaking a lot and at one point I couldn't move my hand, like it was paralyzed. I think they drugged me and I went to sleep and after that I was fine, my breathing was 80% better , I still have to take deep breaths every now and then, but they don't hurt right now. A day later (today/now) my body is so tired (even after I slept for 12 hours) and still, the deep breaths.

For the past couple years I've felt weird. Its only starting to worry me now because it's a constant thing for me now and it's getting worse. I have an anxiety problem so It might just be anxiety. It started when I randomly started feeling exhausted. Before, I was an active runner (I ran at least 5 miles a day and also did sports for 11 hours a week in season) and felt great. Then I started feeling all these symptoms. I feel like im not all the way alert and heat makes it way worse. If it's hot outside, my hands and calves tingle like they're asleep. It used to just be my hands and feet. I also feel like my hands swell up but they aren't. It hurts but it doesn't at the same time. I can't walk in a straight line either. My hands and feet always tingle but it's worse when it's hot. I can't take baths for longer than ten minutes even if it's only a tad bit over 100 degrees (f). My whole body falls asleep (tingles) and I collapse. Like my legs physically give out from underneath me and I can't really move at all. The closest thing I can compare it to is the feeling of being smoking alot of weed but I'm completely sober at the time (I smoke occassionally). When I cool off, I'm fine. I am a competetive swimmer and swimming laps makes me go numb and feel like jello. I can barely move but I'm not sore at all.  Other than all that  I'm just tired a lot and my muscles are sore a lot (when I'm not working out).
